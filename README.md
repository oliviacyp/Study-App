## Schedule App
    
 This ***Schedule App*** is going to help people schedule their time so that each day is more productive. It 
 will schedule events at the times specified by the user, and then display the name of the event at the specified
 time, as a sort of reminder. The ***Schedule App*** will also have secondary functions to help organize and 
 keep track of the event "alarms" set, with a friendly user interface to hopefully encourage a less stressful day.
 
 Anybody who may want to keep track of their day can use this application, but it is certainly geared more towards
 students, who may need the extra help keeping up with their tasks, especially with online learning. This project
 is of interest to me because I am definitely one of those people who needs some extra help keeping my time 
 organized. I actually had an idea for this a while ago, and this project helped me get it started. However, it 
 still has a long way to go, and this is only the most basic set up of what I had imagined. 

List of Possible Refactoring To Do:
- Split SchedulerGUI into multiple Class files instead of all Classes contained in one
- SchedulerGUI extend App
